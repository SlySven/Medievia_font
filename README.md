# Medievia_font
A reworking of the font (see http://www.medievia.com/fonts.html) used by the Medievia MUD Game.

## Todo
* Copy (or copy reference to) glyphs that are "well-known" (like the line drawing ones) to their "standard" position in the `.sfd` (`fontforge` font editing application) file.
* Copy (or copy reference to) glyphs that are not "well-known" to a block in a Private Use Area so that the **[widecharwidth](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/widecharwidth/)** (or other `wcwidth`) implementations no longer give bogus widths because the original locations are in the C1 control character slots that are not assigned *any* space.
* Import "better" glyphs from the Dejavu Sans Mono for some that have them (e.g. "skull{ and crossbones}").

## In relation to other projects
* In **[Mudlet](https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet.git)** create a new text *codec* in the `TTextCodec` class to support the **Medievia True Type font** [original here](http://www.medievia.com/fonts/MedSansMono.ttf) as modified herein, Medievia currently seems to use a modification of the [Window-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) encoding; however some additional character codes that are *not* defined by that encoding have been used which are (rightly) rejected by Mudlet. Work on the new codec has been done by myself but the issue of glyphs having bad Unicode codepoints (e.g. as C1 control characters) has gotten in the way. The initial workaround will be to ensure copies of the problematic glyphs (at least) are moved up into the Private Use Area in the BMP of the Unicode range and to modify the new codec to use those codepoints instead. However long term it will be desirable to enhance Mudlet so that it can map Extended ASCII characters - like the Medievia specific ones - out of the BMP into one of the Higher [Private Use Areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) in Plane 15 or 16. If that is done then the graphemes concerned could even be registered with the [Under-Conscript Unicode Registry](https://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/).
